# VBA-challenge

Note to grader:

My VBA script keeps getting an overflow error or runtime error 6 whenever it tries to read more than 330 rows.  In addition, the script crashes and will only output one ticker symbol on each sheet.  I also had to close the file and open it again in order to output the results for each year. These errors are probably due to the massive size of the file.  I had better results on the alphabetical testing spreadsheet (it outputted several ticker symbols, although it also crashed and couldn't finish the entire sheet.)

Would you please let me know how I can fix this issue? When looking this up it seems that I need to update Visual Basic for Applications (using version 7.1) or use a registry cleaner on my computer (not sure which one to download and whether it will screw everything up).

Sorry, but I have spent countless hours researching this and I am not finding a simple solution to this problem.

Thanks,
Justin
